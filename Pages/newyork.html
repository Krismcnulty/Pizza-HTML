    <h2>What Makes a NY Style Slice?</h2>
    <p>Although <b>different pizzerias use slightly different techniques
        and ingredients,
    </b>some characteristics are in common for every New York-style pizza:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The dough for the NY-style pies is prepared with 
            bread flour or any other 
            high-gluten type of flour. It is mixed with water
            and yeast and <b>is left to rise and ferment for more 
            than 24 hours.</b>Afterward, it is <b>hand-tossed by savvy pizzailolos</b>
        </li>
        <li>The sauce is made of cooked tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, salt, 
            sugar, and herbs like oregano and basil, creating a bit sweet
            and tangy tomato sauce. It gets spread evenly but sparingly, because 
            no one likes a soggy crust.</li>
        <li><b>The cheese used for NY-style pizza is grated full-fat 
            mozzarella.</b> However, Pizzerias use low-moisture mozzarella,
            avoiding the risk of unwanted soggy crust.
        </li>
        <li>The condiments typically used on pies are dried or fresh oregano
            and basil, chilli flakes, fresh garlic or garlic powder,
            and grated parmesan cheese.
         </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>One slice of NY-style pizza can have around 200 calories.</b></p>
