    <h1>Sicilian Pizza</h1>
    <p>Sicilian pizza is a bread lover's dream. The crust of
        a pan-baked Sicilian pie is similar to focaccia bread around
        offers the perfect crunch/chew ratio to support the zesty
        sauce and melted cheese on top. If you've never had a Sicilian
        slice before, you need to change that ASAP.

    <h2>What's in a Sicilian Pizza?</h2>
    <p><b>The authentic Sicilian pizza made in Italy is called 
        sfincione,</b> which translates to a thick sponge.
    </p>
    <p><b>The Dough</b> is thick but spongy and fluffy because 
        of the longer proofing time, and it resembles the focaccia bread dough
    </p>
    <p><b>The sauce</b> is made with crushed tomatoes, onions, ancovies
        herbs, and hard cheese like caciocavallo and toma. Often, the cheese
        goes on the dough first, and the tomatoes are put on top.
    </p>
    <p><b>No rolling or tossing is required.</b></p>
    <p><b>A slice of delicious Sicilian Pizza can have from
        250 to 500 calories.</b></p>
